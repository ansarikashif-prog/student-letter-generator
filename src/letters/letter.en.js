To the Examination Controller / CDOE Administration,

I am writing this letter to formally place on record my academic experience as a student of the BA (ODL) programme under the Centre for Distance and Online Education, Jamia Millia Islamia. I chose this programme with the expectation that, as a reputed Central University, the institution would follow a disciplined academic calendar and ensure timely academic support as outlined in the prospectus. Unfortunately, my experience from the first year onwards has been otherwise.

During my first year, there were extended periods where no clear information was shared by the Centre. For several months, I remained uncertain about academic timelines and the availability of study material. I, along with many other students, repeatedly contacted the Centre through emails and visits, especially regarding books. The responses were limited to assurances such as “you will be informed,” but no concrete information was provided. Eventually, study material was distributed only shortly before examinations, leaving very little time for preparation. As a result, academic performance was severely impacted. In the 2023 batch, which consisted of more than 2000 students, approximately 1300 students failed in one or more subjects. This is a significant and concerning figure for a Central University and reflects systemic shortcomings rather than individual incapability. The first year itself stretched to nearly 15–17 months.

The delay in the first year led to a compressed and academically stressful second year, which was completed within approximately 7–8 months. Assignments were announced suddenly, followed by examinations without adequate preparation time. During this period, many students, including myself, had to make multiple visits to the Centre to collect books, only to be told repeatedly that the material was unavailable. In some cases, books were not provided even until after examinations. Such unpredictability made structured academic preparation nearly impossible.

Despite opting for the offline mode at the time of admission, both the first and second years were largely conducted online. This directly contradicts the option provided during admission. Explanations citing post-COVID adjustments or logistical difficulties do not appear reasonable when academic rules and timelines are strictly enforced on students. If students are expected to adhere to institutional rules, the system must also consistently adhere to its own commitments.

Throughout this period, there was a serious lack of coordination and communication. Official notices were either delayed or absent, and email responses were often late or not received at all. Students were left to speculate about academic developments without any formal guidance. After the completion of second-year examinations on 24 August 2025, no clear or official update regarding result declaration has been communicated.

When I approached the Centre, I was informed that the results had already been forwarded to the Examination Controller in October. However, approaching the Examination Controller’s office has not provided any resolution. Students are redirected repeatedly, often citing technical issues, without accountability or clarity. This back-and-forth has left me in a position where I am unable to identify where responsibility lies.

The academic impact of this prolonged uncertainty is serious. Due to irregular classes, delayed material, and lack of structured academic support, foundational concepts have weakened over time. While distance education does require self-study, it does not absolve the institution of its responsibility to provide timely study material, academic guidance, and predictable examination processes. Delayed books, irregular classes, and now delayed results together have had a direct negative effect on academic outcomes.

In the third year, I have observed some improvement. Books are being provided comparatively earlier, and offline classes are being conducted for four out of six subjects. However, issues still persist. Several students have not received complete course material for subjects such as BEG-04, BEG-05, BHD-04, and BHD-05, citing stock unavailability. Additionally, assignments have been announced with very short submission timelines, along with a requirement for hardcopy submission. For students residing outside Delhi—in states such as Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, or even Maharashtra—this requirement poses a serious practical difficulty.

Another major concern that has intensified in the third year is the fee submission process. Based on my experience, the Jamia fee submission portal has significant technical flaws. Student data is often not updated correctly; in some cases, multiple records appear, while in others, no record appears at all. Even after successful payment, fee submission slips are sometimes not generated, despite the amount being deducted and confirmation emails being received. Such email confirmations are often not accepted by the Centre, forcing students to make repeated visits for verification. Although the student is not at fault, the inconvenience and stress are borne entirely by the student.

These concerns are not being raised merely to revisit past difficulties, but to highlight systemic patterns that must be addressed so that future students do not face similar disruptions. Institutional improvement is only possible when such experiences are formally acknowledged and corrected.

At present, my most serious and immediate concern is the non-declaration of the second-year BA (ODL) result. Without the result, I am unable to assess my academic standing or plan my next steps. In case of any backlog, there will be insufficient time for preparation, which directly affects my academic future.

Therefore, I respectfully request the following:

1) Immediate declaration of my Second Year BA (ODL) result, or at the very least, an officially notified and reliable timeline.  
2) Adequate time and clarity for backlog preparation, if applicable.  
3) Flexibility in assignment submission modes, especially allowing online submission where feasible.  
4) Timely and complete availability of prescribed study material for all subjects.  
5) Resolution of technical and verification issues related to the fee submission portal.

I submit this representation in good faith and with due respect to the administrative processes of the University. I sincerely hope that these concerns will be treated with the urgency they warrant, particularly with regard to result declaration, so that my academic progress may continue without further uncertainty.
